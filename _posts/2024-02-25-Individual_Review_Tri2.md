## Project Overview:
My team's idea was to create a website that could help students get the resources they need to succeed, even from home. As students ourselves, we found that it would be helpful to be able to ask questions that our peers or teachers could help us out with. Users of our site can both ask and answer questions.

## My contribution:
For my contribution to the project, I added an update and delete user function. This way, users could either update their profile information including their username or date of birth. With my function, users could also delete themselves from the database as well.

## Final Reflection
This trimester certainly had ups and downs, and I was quite frankly happy that I was able to work with such a good team. I learned how to code javascript, since I was a frontend developer, which was not my strong suit at the beginning of the trimester. Overall, I had a great experience and learned many new skills I can apply next trimester.
