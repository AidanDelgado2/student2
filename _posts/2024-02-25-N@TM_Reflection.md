## Team Review

## Glows:
One thing that we did well was the presentation of the website, since many people who came by seemed to be impressed by our layout and overall neatness that the website had. Another thing that we did well was our search function, which allowed people to access questions that they had previously asked. Overall, our presentation displayed a site with depth and with many different intricate parts that put together a solid website that is useful for people around the world.

## Grows:
So, while we’re happy with how things are going, we’re also excited to keep making progress and making our project even better. Based on feedback we received, one valuable addition we plan to incorporate into our individual CPT project is a filter for the most commonly asked questions or topics. Some parents suggested this feature, recognizing its potential to enhance user experience by streamlining access to frequently sought information. By implementing this filter, users will be able to quickly locate relevant content, saving time and improving overall satisfaction with our project. This addition aligns with our goal of continuously refining and optimizing our project to better meet the needs of our audience.

- In class: One project that I was impressed by was the CSSE project by Dean Phillips. Him and his group demoed a multiplayer mario game that their entire class created, which I played with my friend Jared. This project was cool because the games were in sync and we were able to compete against each other. This could be turned into a great project in the future and reach many people around the world. The impact that this site could have, given time, could turn into something big.
- Out of class: I went to the drawing and painting room in which I viewed a cool drawing of a little boy which used lots of shadows and different shades to make a realistic looking piece of art. What was most impressive was how it was made in black and white. The drawing made me acknowledge the simplicity of using a blank color palate in art and allowed me to focus on the subject more than the colors that made up the art.
