## Team Review
## Glows/grows:
As we looked back on our project demo, we found some things we’re doing well and areas where we can improve. One thing we’re proud of is our website. It’s coming along nicely and works really smoothly. It’s also a great place for people to work together and help each other out. But, we know we need to do better at getting more people involved. Having more people on board could bring in fresh ideas and make our project even better. We also want to keep improving our website, adding more cool features to make it even more useful for everyone involved. So, while we’re happy with how things are going, we’re also excited to keep making progress and making our project even better. Based on feedback we received, one valuable addition we plan to incorporate into our individual CPT project is a filter for the most commonly asked questions or topics. Some parents suggested this feature, recognizing its potential to enhance user experience by streamlining access to frequently sought information. By implementing this filter, users will be able to quickly locate relevant content, saving time and improving overall satisfaction with our project. This addition aligns with our goal of continuously refining and optimizing our project to better meet the needs of our audience.

## Review of Event:
- In class: One project that I was impressed by was the CSSE project by Dean Phillips. Him and his group demoed a multiplayer mario game that their entire class created, which I played with my friend Jared. This project was cool because the games were in sync and we were able to compete against each other.
- Out of class: I went to the drawing and painting room in which I viewed a cool drawing of a little boy which used lots of shadows and different shades to make a realistic looking piece of art. What was most impressive was how it was made in black and white.
