## Missed Question refelctions:
- score: 29/32 (unfinished)
- Question 10: I answered answer D when the correct answer was C. I missed this question because I miscounted my binary numbers, which means that it was likely an addition error rather than not knowing how to read binary.
- Question 22: I answerd B when the right answer was A. My answer caused the robot to turn prior to moving forward, while the correct answer has the robot move then turn left in order to make it come back to the center square like the given code segment.
- Question 26: I answered B when the right answer was A. Choice B makes a challenge eliminated rather than identifying one, and answer A makes the most sense since parallel computing would not work when a program depends on a previous part.

## Missed Topics:
- 2.1 Binary numbers: Questions 10, 11, 31, and 39
- 3.8 Iteration: Question 22, 25, 28, 29, and 45
- 3.9 Developing Algorithms: Question 22
- 4.3 Parallel and Distributed computing: Questions 26 and 57

## Study plan for AP exam:
- review previous test results: by examining my questions that I have frequently missed, I can practice these topics to get better at them and the topics they are related to
- study the AP CSP barrons book: starting a month before the exam, I will go over the topics that I have the least knowledge on and then focus on those topics in my studying book by highlighting key terms and going over mini practice quizzes
- binary practice: I feel that my binary computation process is too slow, so I will practice binary worksheets to get better at recognizing common patterns of binary
