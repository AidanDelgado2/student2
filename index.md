## Challenges I Faced:
1. At first, my bundle install would not work because I did not have jupyter properly installed. So, I had to reinstall all my updates again and bundle install finally worked.
2. When changing my theme, my config.yml page would always have a problem whenever I tried to edit the theme on there. My config.yml page would always have an error in it no matter what I changed, even when I copied and pasted the default code off of the teacher github page. I tried over and over again to find the problem, when I realized I could copy and paste one of my classmate's codes that worked for them. I did this and my theme changed to the one I wanted.
